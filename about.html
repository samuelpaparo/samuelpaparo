      samuel paparo is an artist and photographer born in 2004 in sofia, bulgaria. he lives and works in paris, france. his practice combines street and documentary photography with a broader reflection on language, culture, and identity. drawing from his background, he focuses on everyday postures, marginal spaces, and quiet social dynamics. his images often explore what goes unnoticed: people sitting in silence, gestures of detachment, rural emptiness, and the subtle codes of bodies in public space...
after two years in the classe préparatoire littéraire at the lycée henri-iv in paris, where he studied philosophy, history, geography, ancient languages, and literature, he turned to art history, sculpture, and photography. he studied at the sorbonne and took courses in sculpture and drawing. this path shaped a way of seeing that is both analytical and intuitive, grounded in observation rather than commentary.
his work is often shot in bulgaria, where he returns regularly. the themes that come back—solitude, repetition, informal arrangements of people and objects reflect a sensitivity to rhythm and social texture. recurring visual elements include horses, motorcycles, people waiting, and spaces that seem in-between.
he self-publishes photozines and develops long-term series that combine image, fieldwork, and language.
