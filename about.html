      samuel paparo is an artist and photographer born in 2004 in sofia, bulgaria. he lives and works in paris, france. <p>his practice combines street and documentary photography with a broader reflection on language, culture, and identity.<p> drawing from his background, he focuses on <br>everyday postures, <br>marginal spaces, <br>and quiet social dynamics.<p> <p>his images often explore what goes unnoticed: people sitting in silence, gestures of detachment, rural emptiness, and the subtle codes of bodies in public space...
<p>after two years in the classe préparatoire littéraire at the lycée henri-iv in paris, where he studied <br>philosophy, <br>history, <br>geography, <br>ancient languages, <br>and literature,<br><br><p> <p>he turned to <br><br>art history, <br>sculpture, <br>and photography. <br>he studied at the sorbonne and took courses in sculpture and drawing.<p> this path shaped a way of seeing that is both analytical and intuitive, grounded in observation rather than commentary.<p>
his work is often shot in bulgaria, where he returns regularly. <p>the themes that come back<br>solitude, <br>repetition, <br>informal arrangements of people and objects reflect a sensitivity to rhythm and social texture. recurring visual elements include <br>horses, <br>motorcycles, <br>people waiting, <br>and spaces that seem in-between.<p><br><br>
he self-publishes photozines and develops long-term series that combine image, fieldwork, and language.
