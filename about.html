    <p>
      I'm samuel paparo, an artist and photographer born in 2004 in sofia, bulgaria.
      after two years spent sat at the lyc√©e henri-iv in paris studying philosophy, history and geography as well as ancient and modern languages and literature, I pursued art history, sculpture, drawing, and street photography.
     my work explores sociological and linguistic themes shaped by a dual bulgarian-french culture and liberal arts education.
